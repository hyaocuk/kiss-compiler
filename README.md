This is a simple compiler which compile the simply grammaticle sourcecode.

<p>And in fact we are trying hard to make it simple and concise that just fits our title of this compiler---kiss, just to <strong>K</strong>eep <strong>I</strong>t <strong>S</strong>imple and <strong>S</strong>tupid</p>

<p>so our main goal is to make it available on the Web using the JavaScript to implement the front-end that mainly provide a textbox, in which you can paste your sourcecode and click run to get the final result.</p>
